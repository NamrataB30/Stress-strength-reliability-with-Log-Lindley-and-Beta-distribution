# Stress-strength-reliability-with-Log-Lindley-and-Beta-distribution
Estimation of stress–strength reliability  𝑅 = 𝑃 ( 𝑋 &lt; 𝑌 ) R=P(X&lt;Y) using Log-Lindley and Beta distributions via MLE, numerical integration, and Monte-Carlo simulation with R programing.

This repository contains my M.Sc. dissertation work.
For complete details of the methodology, simulations, and implementation, including the code, please refer to the PDF included in this repository.
